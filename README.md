A Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that can determine whether two given questions are semantically similar or not. The system will analyze the semantic meaning and context of the questions, beyond just comparing the literal words used. This can have applications in question-answering systems, chatbots, and other areas where understanding the intent behind user queries is important.
